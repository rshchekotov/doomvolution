  '***__Part I: Introduction__***\n' +
    'In order to introduce you to the bots philosophy, let me ' +
    'explain what it is inspired by. The bots is built in a ' +
    'similar way to Unix (an operating system). You can get what ' +
    "you like and remove what you don't like and you're only " +
    'forced to have what is necessary for the bot to work as intended!\n' +
    'In this little tutorial you will learn how to list all ' +
    'available modules, how to obtain information on one of those ' +
    'modules, how to install a module and, if it has required ' +
    'settings configure those before! And to end the workflow, ' +
    "we'll uninstall the module, so you can enjoy a fresh start!\n" +
    "Whenever you see a 'üñ•Ô∏è' it means that you should run the " +
    'commands attached in a code-block below in order to proceed ' +
    'with the tutorial!\n' +
    'React with a ‚úÖ to get to the next page (this also applies to ' +
    'all the following pages). To get back to the last page, feel ' +
    "free to react with a '‚óÄÔ∏è' You can halt the tutorial at any " +
    "point by reacting with '‚ùå'.",

  '***__Part II: Module Manager (modman)__***\n' +
    'Most workflow for this bot uses 2 commands - `man` and `modman`. ' +
    "First we'll look at latter! To provide a quick definition: " +
    'modman - the Module Manager - is used to search, install and ' +
    'remove individual modules of the bot - features if you wish.\n' +
    "Let's start with listing all available features! This can be " +
    'achieved using: üñ•Ô∏è ```$modman search all```Now you probably got ' +
    'a list of decent size. You will be able to inspect that list and ' +
    "get everything that you like later, but for now let's stick with " +
    'the "ready" module!\n' +
    'In order to install a module, you have to type üñ•Ô∏è' +
    "```$modman install ready```Now a message indicating, that you're " +
    'missing a configuration should pop up! Those configurations are ' +
    'going to appear from time to time, when installing new modules and ' +
    'are required settings for the module to work. How to check what each ' +
    'configuration means will be shown in Part III. In this case, we simply ' +
    'need to specify a channel id, which will serve as the channel, where ' +
    'the "ready" message will pop up. To do this, we type following üñ•Ô∏è, ' +
    'but make sure to use your channel-id instead of mine. This is just so you know how ' +
    'it should look like' +
    '```$modman set channel="842751898808877087"```' +
    'Now, you can install the "ready" module and everything will work as ' +
    'it should! As the last thing in this part, we\'ll uninstall "ready" ' +
    'by using üñ•Ô∏è: ```$modman remove ready```This should give you a ' +
    'notification, that "ready" was removed successfully!',

  '***__Part III: Wonderful Manual ([wo]man)__***\n' +
    "Now we'll get to the interesting part. We already can list modules, " +
    'install, remove and set options for them! At the moment we still have ' +
    'no idea though what exactly those modules do! To resolve this problem, ' +
    "I created a per-default installed utility called 'man'. It provides us " +
    'with helpful information about individual modules! For example you should ' +
    'try üñ•Ô∏è ```$man ready```Now you know what we installed and removed in Part ' +
    'II. You can put any module, which is listed in `$modman search all` after ' +
    '`$man ` and receive information about it! As soon as you feel ready, you can ' +
    'open the manual entry for "modman". It\'s quite long, but also explains ' +
    'quite well what you can do in terms of module manipulation with this bot!\n' +
    "Now let's get to the last bit of this tutorial: Providing Date to Modules. " +
    'Some modules, such as "embed" require a complex data structure to be provided ' +
    "for them to work! This is exactly what we'll cover in this last part. First - " +
    'let\'s install the "embed" module, I\'ll assume you know how that goes, if ' +
    'you read everything from Part II. Now, to use it, I first recommend to read ' +
    "it's manual to grasp what it does. After having read it, you should know now " +
    'how to use the Bot.',

  '***__Part IV: Conclusion__***\n' +
    "Reevaluating everything that you've learnt in this tutorial one can say, that now " +
    "you're able to search, install, uninstall and configure modules as well as provide " +
    'data for more complex modules, such as: "embed", "fact" and "quote" (at the time of ' +
    'writing this - the only ones)!\n' +
    "I - Doomie, hope that you'll have lots of fun and find joy in using this Bot! I'm " +
    'trying to add new features as I write this, so - be prepared for more cool modules!\n' +
